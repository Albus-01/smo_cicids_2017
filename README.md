# smo_cicids_2017
This project trains a PyTorch neural network on the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset for intrusion detection. It uniquely employs a custom Spider Monkey Optimization (SMO) algorithm, a swarm intelligence technique, instead of gradient-based optimizers, providing a practical example of metaheuristic algorithms in cybersecurity.
